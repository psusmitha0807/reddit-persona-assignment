  > "Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party... I was at the wrong party."

- City Life and its Transient Nature: The user reflects on their own transient status in NYC, comparing their three years to the interns' three months. This suggests a fascination with the city's dynamic population and the various stages of life within it.

- Video Games (Potentially Strategy Games): The comments about game completion and storing resources suggest an interest in video games, possibly those with resource management or strategy elements.
  > "Sorry to hear that man, in the future you may want to have multiple granaries, one close to your berries/deer/fish and one for your veggies/apples/honey. Also I just store ale at the tavern or keep it in the brewery for this reason."
